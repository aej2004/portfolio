                    I'm a senior computer science major with a minor in data analytics. I will have been studying at Berry for 4 year 
                    graduating in May 2026. Planning to pursue a job in the web design and development field after college. I'm 
                    involved in the Stem Legions Scholarship and currently hold a 3.5 GPA and have made the Dean's List 4 times so 
                    far.

                    Over the Summer of 2025, I completed Cornell's online Web Design and Development certification. This course introduced
                    me to the fundamentals of web design, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. I learned how to create
                    visually appealing and user-friendly websites that provide an engaging experience for all users. The course also covered
                    best practices for web development, including accessibility and usability.

                    My very first year at Berry, I was one of the few freshman picked to interview for the Office of Admissions. After 
                    being selected, I was trained to give campus tours, provide customer service both in-person and over the phone, 
                    transport prospective students around campus, help with various events throughout the year, and complete many other 
                    office tasks.
