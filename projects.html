                    CSC404: Programming Languages ~ The goal of this project is to design and implement a programming language of your 
                    own with a partner. My partner and I are using Java to build our language called Mov. Mov's purpose will be to access 
                    and interpret information about movies and all that encompasses them. It's syntax is designed to be straightforward 
                    and easy to read for the user. Allowing the user the ability to access a movie data base of movie reviews and 
                    information to complete certain task.

                <p>
                    To better organize showcase my work and experiences, I created a profolio website that contains all the information that
                    I want to share with potential employers. This website was built using HTML and CSS, and it is designed to be visually appealing
                    and easy to navigate. The profolio includes sections for my projects, skills, education, and contact information.
